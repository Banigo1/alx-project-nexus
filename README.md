# Pollify (Poll System Backend) 
  This project is a robust Django-based backend for an online poll system that provides APIs for poll creation, voting, and real-time result computation with user authentication and authorization.

Project Nexus is a key milestone in the ProDev Backend Engineering program. It serves as the capstone experience where learners demonstrate their ability to apply backend development skills to a real-world project.

## Project Nexus: How Mentors Score

Your backend project will be assessed based on the following categories. Ensure your project meets or exceeds expectations for a high score!

‚ùå Below 60% ‚Äì Not Validated üî¥
Projects in this range need significant improvements to be considered complete.

## Functionality & Features

Core backend functionality is missing or incomplete.
API endpoints do not work as expected.
Frequent errors or crashes, making the system unreliable.
Code Quality & Best Practices
Code is unstructured, repetitive, or difficult to read.
No use of GitHub for version control.
Poor or no adherence to best practices in Django, FastAPI, or chosen framework.
Database Design & Efficiency
Poorly structured database with inefficient queries.
No normalization or indexing, leading to slow performance.
API responses are inconsistent or do not follow RESTful/GraphQL principles.
Security & Performance
No authentication/authorization implemented.
API is vulnerable to common security threats (SQL injection, CSRF, etc.).
Poor performance with slow response times and high latency.

### Documentation & Presentation

README file is missing or lacks essential details.
No API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
Unable to clearly explain technical decisions during the presentation.
üëç 60% - 80% ‚Äì Good Job! üü°

## A solid project that meets expectations but could benefit from refinements.

Functionality & Features ‚Äì All core features are implemented and mostly work as intended.
Code Quality & Best Practices ‚Äì Code is structured and somewhat readable, but could be cleaner.
Database Design & Efficiency ‚Äì Schema is well-structured but could be optimized.
Security & Performance ‚Äì Authentication and authorization are implemented but not fully optimized.

### Documentation & Presentation ‚Äì README file is present but lacks detail or clarity.
üåü 80%+ ‚Äì Exceptional Work! üü¢
An outstanding project that demonstrates excellence in all areas.

Functionality & Features ‚Äì Goes beyond the basics with additional enhancements (e.g., background tasks, real-time updates).
Code Quality & Best Practices ‚Äì Clean, modular, and well-documented code with effective GitHub usage.
Database Design & Efficiency ‚Äì Well-optimized schema with indexing, normalization, and efficient queries.
Security & Performance ‚Äì Strong authentication, security best practices, and high performance.
Documentation & Presentation ‚Äì Well-structured README, API documentation, and confident presentation.
